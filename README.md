# Social-Insects
These are sample R codes for gene selection used in the paper "Tensor decomposition-based and principal-component-analysis-based unsupervised feature extraction applied to the gene expression and methylation profiles in the brains of social insects with multiple castes" https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-018-2068-7

GEO files used in sample.R should be downloaded from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE59525
13059_2012_3057_MOESM9_ESM.CSV should be downloaded from https://static-content.springer.com/esm/art%3A10.1186%2Fgb-2013-14-2-r20/MediaObjects/13059_2012_3057_MOESM9_ESM.CSV

Execute sample.R in order get to get gene list available at Additional file 1 (https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-018-2068-7)
(It also requires to execute externally several bacth files, R11.bat to R27.bat, during execution. See sample.R for more details)

R version 3.4.2 (2017-09-28) -- "Short Summer" : This R code seems to be valid in this version. No other version might not be supported.
